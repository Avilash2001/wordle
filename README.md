# Wordle Practicer 🎯

I made this simple Wordle clone because I got tired of paywalls and daily limits. I just wanted to play Wordle to my heart's content — anytime, as much as I want — without restrictions.

This project is built using:

* **Next.js (App Router)**
* **TypeScript**
* **Tailwind CSS** + **ShadCN** components
* **Datamuse API** for dynamic 5-letter words

### Features:

* ✅ Real Wordle behavior (5-letter word, 6 attempts)
* ✅ Onscreen keyboard + physical keyboard support
* ✅ Color feedback like the original game
* ✅ No account, no ads, no nags — just Wordle

### Why?

Because some fun things in life should stay simple, free, and infinite.

Feel free to fork, play, or improve it. No strings attached.
